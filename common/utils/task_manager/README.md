Task Manager
=========================

General
-----------
Task manager is a simple abstraction to handle tasks concurrently.
It consists of the following 3 functions that can be found in
task\_manager\_gen header file.

1. init\_task\_manager
  * Initialize the task manager. The first argument is the type, while the
    second and third argument are a list of the cores where the threads
    should be pinned to and its size. Only a range within the core id of the
    machine is valid i.e., min. 0 max. output of the command \$nproc --all.
    A -1 represents floating threads. There is no guarantee that the
    underlying thread pool pins the threads to the cores.
2.  free\_task\_manager
  * Free the resources acquired by init. Terminate the running threads.
3.  async\_task\_manager
  * Asynchronously send a task to the task manager. The second argument is a
    task that consists of a function pointer where the task will run and a
    void* arg to the function. Similar syntax to c++ std::async.

Joining tasks
-----------

For joining the tasks, a decoupled mechanism is also provided in the file
task\_ans.h
There are two methods:
1. completed\_task\_ans
  * Once the task is finished, it can itself announce that it finished
2. join\_task\_ans
  * This is a blocking join point. It will wait for all the tasks to be
    completed before continuing.
